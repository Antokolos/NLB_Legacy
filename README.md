NLB_Legacy
==========

Legacy NLBB version 0.1, written in C++ (Windows, MFC)

This program is the first version of NLB Builder.
NLB Builder is the program for creating Non-Linear Books (also known as Interactive Fiction novels).
I do not recommend using it, because it lacks many features, but it is still usable.
Anyway, I think that this is good idea to post this on GitHub.

To get the new, better, cross-platform version of this program, please see:
https://github.com/Antokolos/NLB -- source code
http://nlbhub.ru/dist/NLBB.zip -- program launcher (needs Java >= 1.7 to be installed, also run scripts should be tweaked)
http://nlbhub.ru/dist/NLBB_WithJRE.zip -- program distributive with Java Runtime included (click and run version for Windows)
